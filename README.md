=========================

###Course Project for Coursera Data Science Specialization : Getting and Cleaning Data
This project is part of the [Getting and Cleaning Data Course](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata) from [Coursera](www.coursera.org).

###Data Description.

This project extracts a subset of Samsung Galaxy S Intertial Measurements and creates a tidy summary of the data.
The [course data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) is part of the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The 
description of the data can be obtained [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

###Script Description

The main script for this project [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/MattLWhitaker/CleaningDataCourseProject/blob/master/run_analysis.R)
As written it assumes that the script is in a folder with the test and training folders in subfolders (test and train). The files with the
activity labels and the field descriptors are assumed to be in the same folder as the the script. These are easily changed in the data sources
section of the script.
